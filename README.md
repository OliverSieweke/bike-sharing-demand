# Whatever

This project proposes machine learning models to forecast bike rental demand in 
Washinton's [Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) program.
Predictions are being submitted to Kaggle's
*[Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview)* competition.

The project's scope was limited to exploring how far one could get with various 
feature engineering strategies in conjunction with linear regressions.

## Data and whatever

The data is to be found in [`data/original`](data/original) and was downloaded from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data) on the **04.05.20**. It consists 
of a time series containing various information __on__ the type of day and weather `conditions`.

> asdfasdf
> asdfsadfsadf
> adsfsadf and then we don't know assadf asdf asdf 
> adsf asdf asdfasdf ad sfasd fasdf  asdf asdf asdf

The data is split up into: 

### [This is a subtitle](httt://www.google.com)

- [`train.csv`](data/original/train.csv) which comprises the first 19 days of each month, for which `const a = 10`
the number of bike rentals is known.
- [`test.csv`](data/original/train.csv) which comprises the days following [the][1]  and this is it.
20th of each month, for which the number of bike rentals is unknown and should be *predicted*.
[a][3]
